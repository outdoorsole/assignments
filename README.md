Introduction
============

This repository consists of multiple Problems one must accomplish as an extra
curricular course. Language choice between C++ and Python depends on you,
however there are extra credit opportunities which ask for both languages to
be implemented.

Grading
=======

Assignments will be graded on correctness, performance, and style. Extra credit
points will count toward the final average of the grade.
