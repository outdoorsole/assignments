Problem 2
=========

Sort a vector/list of values from lowest to highest <i>in-place</i> without
using a language provided sorting function. No sample output is needed, but
your function will be tested.

Possible sample output from a sorting program could be:

    [user@host ~]$ ./program
    Input a list of strings separated by spaces: Raw Dog Meat
    Dog
    Meat
    Raw
    [user@host ~]$

Requirement: Implement a proper sorting algorithm.

You will be graded on your correctness, performance, and style.

Requirement: Implement a low-to-high sorting algorithm for C++ or Python.

Extra Credit: Implement a generic sorting algorithm. That is, one that
does not care about the type given to it. In C++, you can do this by using
templates.
